I pride myself on being a well-organized, independent, and driven student. Looking ahead at the future I plan to head the Public Relations of Marketing Management route. I enjoy the idea of helping people and organizations reach their public branding goals through my creativity and hard work. In my upcoming junior year I plan to study abroad in Florence, Italy during the winterim, where I will take a few courses on marketing strategies internationally to gain new experiences and knowledge. Following my Junior year I hope to get an internship focused around marketing or PR.</p></div>
